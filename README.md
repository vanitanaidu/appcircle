## Description of Project
This is a mini facebook app for retirees. Retirees often struggle with unexciting and almost non-existent social lives.  So, I wanted to create a place for the next generation of retirees (who will be increasingly computer savvy), where they have opportunities to connect with friends they might have lost touch with or make new friends.
